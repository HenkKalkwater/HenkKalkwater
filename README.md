I am Chris, a Computer Science student.

Things that interest me:
* Linux and mobile Linux distros, such as SailfishOS and Ubuntu Touch.
* Creating GUIs, especially in QML. I haven't found a GUI framework yet that sparks the same joy as Qt
* Operating Systems, especially those with microkernels.
* Open standards and free software. Ironically I'm writing this on GitHub.
